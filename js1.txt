JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms
 to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, 
 and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
 prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
